 JSX allows us to write HTML-like code in our javascript files.
 jsx is a syntax extension of javascript that cerates a very special
  and wxtremely productive marriage between HTML js
 
 Declarative and imparative programming.
JSX uses what is called decalrative style of programming whereas creating DOM elements using javasnript methods
would be imparative. 
Imparative code describes how an action is to be done step by step 
while declarative describe what the outcome should be.

JSX is the return value of a fucntional component.
